      <p><b>Our Little Slice of Aviation Paradise: </b>Nestled in Johannesburg South, Tedderfield Airpark started life
        as
        a peach farm and has since evolved into a buzzing, vibrant airfield that offers so much. And yes, we've kept a
        little of that peach-farm charm.</p>

      <p><b>A Runway with a View: </b>Runway 11/29 may not have the longest stretch in the world, but it more than makes
        up for it with unbeatable views and a smooth, well-maintained surface. Just watch out for the occasional
        crosswind
        gust - a Tedderfield trademark. And don't forget to wave at the clubhouse on your downwind leg! Well maybe not!
      </p>

      <p class="text-size-20"><b>Flying In:</b></p>

      <p><b>Circuit Patterns and Joining Procedures: </b>At Tedderfield, we like to keep it straightforward with simple
        circuits unless otherwise noted. We recommend you check out our joining and landing procedures - taking in a
        wide
        view of the airfield to make sure you're aware of any fellow aviators in the area. (Pro tip: Everyone
        appreciates
        a good lookout!)</p>

      <p><b>Wind Socks and Local Wildlife: </b>Keep an eye on the wind socks, and yes they are fickle and often indicate
        differing directions simultaneously. If you see a furry friend roaming nearby - don't worry, we're on it. Still,
        a
        quick check for feathered and furred traffic on finals won't hurt.</p>

      <p class="text-size-20"><b>Landing Tips:</b></p>

      <p><b>Grease it Down, Please! </b>We take pride in keeping our landings as smooth as possible, not only for your
        comfort but also to keep our neighbours happy. (And yes, we can all hear that last-minute power-up!) Let's leave
        the corkscrews and cowboy landings for the aerobatic clubs and aim to keep it classy.</p>

      <p><b>Traffic Awareness: </b>Be mindful of who's around and what they're up to. Our radio etiquette is
        light-hearted
        but polite. If you can keep chatter to a minimum and convey essentials (without too much sass), everyone
        benefits.
      </p>

      <p class="text-size-20"><b>On the Ground:</b></p>

      <p><b>Parking and Tiedowns: </b>Prime parking awaits! Secure your aircraft in the best spots for weather
        protection
        and proximity to clubhouse amenities. Look out for the signage, along the northern side of the tarred runway.
        Don't be shy to ask about anything.</p>

      <p><b>Fred - Chairman Extraordinaire: </b>He's our official meeting wrangler. Both a diplomat and seeker of
        equitable outcomes, he's our North Star even though conversations may sometimes drift off course if there's an
        interesting aviation topic involved.</p>

      <p><b>Ian - The Treasurer with a Passion for Rules: </b>A stickler for the books and a champion of the Sectional
        Title Act, Ian's got the numbers handled, keeping us accountable and on our toes.</p>

      <p><b>Nic - The Green Minded Secretary: </b>Nic's all about greening up Tedderfield and is passionate about
        ensuring our airfield is in top shape. A perfectionist by nature, we know he won't settle for second best. </p>

        ready to roll up his sleeves.</p>

      <p><b>Manfred - The Veteran with a Heart for Maintenance: </b>Manfred has been here long enough to know every bolt
        and runway stripe at Tedderfield. He may be old-school but his aircraft maintenance stories are always
        "interesting."</p>

      <p><b>Cathy - The Voice of Reason: </b>Cathy is sharp and practical, spotting problems before they hit the agenda.
        She keeps discussions focused and is our diplomatic anchor during heated debates.</p>

      <p><b>James - The Legal Eagle: </b>As a lawyer, James might change his mind occasionally, but when he's committed,
        he's all in. His blend of free-spirited idealism and legal acumen ensures that we're always covered.</p>
